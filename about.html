      <h1>About Ahh Bee</h1>
      <p>Hi, I'm Abby deVarennes &mdash; a wine enthusiast and Air Force pilot, not a sommelier or wine expert. This guide is a collection of information I've compiled, tasted, and learned along the way while living or traveling across wine-rich regions. It's meant to be helpful, approachable, and practical for bringing wine home to enjoy &mdash; not intimidating.</p>
      <p class="about-hero__quote">“A good glass of wine is one where you take another sip from.”</p>

            <h2>Growing up in wine country</h2>
            <p>I grew up in Davis California, a university town in between Sacramento and San Francisco. UC Davis has a college for wine making and grape growing that train a lot of the winemakers in Napa. If you watch a wine documentary, there is a good chance they mention UC Davis for their wine school &mdash; its pretty cool.</p>
            <p>I went on a language exchange to France in college and the Professor that took me was a sommelier and a French trained Cordon Bleu chef. She taught me to approach wine and food as a lifestyle. Think about where the grapes are from, what makes that place special, and most importantly &mdash; what do you smell?</p>
          </article>
          <article>
            <h3>The Napa education</h3>
            <p>When I turned 21 my parents took me on a tour of Napa, for my education. They explained the Judgement of Paris (read a small synopsis in Northern California) and we visited the wineries that were apart of the historic tasting. My parents even went on a date at Grgich Hills before they were married and were served by Mike Grgich! My parents said back then it was just a bunch of farmers that like wine and were excited to share for free in the hopes you bought a bottle.</p>
            <h3>My learning stack</h3>
            <p>Since then, I've traveled to a lot of different wine growing regions. I try to read up on where I am going in a very approachable wine book called Wine Folly. Then I will deep dive certain grapes or regions in a book called the Wine Bible. I keep a tasting journal because I usually forget what I think &mdash; I mean after a couple of glasses who could blame me.</p>
            <p>I began to create this guide while dreaming about drinking wine in Crete, while I was stuck in Saudi Arabia. I realized a lot of these cool places the Air Force takes me are prolific wine regions, but most people have no idea what to buy. Hopefully this guide will help you taste something new or bring back great wine to drink later!</p>

            <h3>Davis, California Roots</h3>
            <p>I grew up in Davis, sandwiched between Sacramento and San Francisco. UC Davis is a viticulture powerhouse, so even local field trips pointed toward grape science. If you watch any wine documentary, odds are UC Davis gets name-checked — it made wine feel normal, not elite.</p>
          </article>
          <article class="story-card">
            <h3>Learning in France</h3>
            <p>During a college language exchange, my professor — a sommelier and Cordon Bleu chef — taught me to treat wine and food like a lifestyle. Where are the grapes from? What makes that place special? Start by smelling, then build the story.</p>

            <h3>First Napa Education</h3>
            <p>When I turned 21, my parents marched me through Napa to explain the Judgment of Paris and show me the wineries that turned the wine world upside down. They even went on dates at Grgich Hills before I was born, poured by Mike Grgich himself.</p>

          <p class="about-structure__eyebrow">How to use the site</p>
          <h2>Organization of the Guide</h2>
          <p>Each section is organized into some intro info, a top picks section, BX section, Off-base section, and grape breakdowns. The top picks are the easiest to use and identify what to buy where. The recommendations are a broad generalization of what is grown in the area or what the area is known for. Great for bringing back a bottle to share with your wife or husband!</p>
          <p>The next section are charts of what you can find on base and off base. Typically limited selections from Class Six, shoppettes, or BX/PX but still a decent representation &mdash; especially overseas. Off-base options include nearby wine shops, grocery stores, and boutique spots worth checking out. If you want to get a case of wine that displays a more nuanced version of the region use the charts. My goal is to help others buy great wine without overspending, whether you're in California, Spain, Germany, Crete, or wherever the grapes grow.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="about-structure__card">
          <h3>Why I obsess over charts</h3>
          <p>Seeing percentages helps decode a shelf when labels are all in German or Portuguese. Napa is 54% Cabernet Sauvignon while Sonoma spreads its love between Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, and Zinfandel. Washington balances Riesling, Syrah, and Cabernet in almost equal thirds. Those ratios tell you what the locals are proud of.</p>

          <h3>The Judgment of Paris Spark</h3>
          <p>In 1976, Chateau Montelena Chardonnay and Stag’s Leap Wine Cellars Cabernet beat legendary French bottles in a blind tasting, shocking the world and launching Napa’s modern reputation. That story is why I always include a quick refresher in the California section — context transforms a bottle into history.</p>
        </article>
        <article>
          <h3>Washington’s Everyday Magic</h3>
          <p>Washington vineyards soak up sun all day and cool down fast at night, so the wines stay vibrant, food-friendly, and budget-conscious. It’s why you’ll see Riesling, Merlot, and Cabernet recommendations that feel polished without the Napa price tag.</p>
        </article>
        <article>
          <h3>A Love Letter to Madeira</h3>
          <p>Madeira is intentionally heated and oxidized, which sounds wild until you taste the caramel, nut, and dried fruit notes that can last for years after opening. The Portuguese section explains how each style — Sercial to Malmsey — pairs with everything from aperitifs to dessert.</p>

          <h2>Why I keep writing</h2>
          <p>Wine can feel expensive or exclusive, especially when you’re shopping far from home. By pairing BX finds with boutique shop tips, I want you to feel confident grabbing a $12 Riesling in Germany or splurging on a Stag’s Leap bottle because you understand the story behind it. My goal is to help others buy great wine without overspending, wherever the Air Force sends us.</p>
